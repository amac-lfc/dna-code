1: Make training pool with normal distribution however the test can be the normal distribution

2: independatn samplses t test for change in gene expression for each gene(top 5%)
	BonFeronies correction (tukeys correction)

3: logisical regression for full gene pool with Y

4: find more statistical tests to examin statistical relivance

Compute adv feature expression by quintile per patient 

CONRADS TODO:

Quintile distrabution of DTD

Entropy to say what catagory it contibutes for

Identify a set of 48 or 96 genes that are good quintile preditors

Identify set of genes what are good predictors for live or die

do the same genes come up for diffrence Cancers


#Look into unsupervied higherarchical clustering



FOR REPORT 
make figure of contribution each gene gives



NEW TODO LIST

1) Y = 0,1 Random forest 1K time with all genes, pick top 50 importance genes

2) Y=0,1 100 time with top 50 genes for Adv accuracy with SVM, RF, DT, LR

quintile seperation, top 50, 100times RF, SVM, LR, DT

4) Top 50 importance do a regression tree


5) Y = quinitle vs rest to get indeividual gene importance.
